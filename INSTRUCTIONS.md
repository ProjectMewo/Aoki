# Implementing new stuff

This is a guide on how to work with the Aoki codebase.

## Commands

Aoki's commands follow a very special flow to get to Discord:
- First, create a folder of a `master command`. A master command is a `SubcommandsOnlySlashCommandBuilder`, as in a command with only slash commands in it.
- Create an `index.ts` file in that directory, extending [Command.ts](src/struct/handlers/Command.ts). For example, a `/fun` master command:
```ts
// src/cmd/fun/index.ts
import Command from '@struct/handlers/Command';

export default class Fun extends Command {
  constructor() {
    super({
      name: 'fun',
      description: 'some commands for funny stuff',
      cooldown: 0,
      subcommands: []
    })
  }
}
```
- Then, implement a `subcommand` of the master command in the same folder, extending [Subcommand.ts](src/struct/handlers/Subcommand.ts) this time. For example, a `/fun ping` command:
```ts
// src/cmd/fun/ping.ts
// This file also exports an interface for command options
import { Subcommand } from '@struct/handlers/Subcommand';

export default class Ping extends Subcommand {
  constructor() {
    super({
      name: 'ping',
      description: 'see if I respond.',
      // Even though there are no permission required
      // and no options, they are not optional, so
      // make sure these are all present
      permissions: [],
      options: []
    });
  };
}
```
- The code snippet above shows how to initialize the subcommand in our `/fun` master command. The actual implementation of the command is in the `execute` method, for example:
```ts
// Sub-content of src/cmd/fun/ping.ts
import { ChatInputCommandInteraction } from 'discord.js';

public async execute(i: ChatInputCommandInteraction): Promise<void> {
  // Write normal discord.js code
  await i.reply({ content: "I am watching you!" });
};
```
- After you've made a new subcommand, it's time to let the master command know its presence. Because this project is statically built with Bun (very similar to `esbuild`), using `node:fs` is not recommended:
```ts
// src/cmd/fun/index.ts
import Command from '@struct/handlers/Command';
import Ping from './ping';

export default class Fun extends Command {
  constructor() {
    super({
      name: 'fun',
      description: 'some commands for funny stuff',
      cooldown: 0,
      subcommands: [new Ping]
    })
  }
}
```
- To publish this command to Discord, head over to the [Client.ts](src/struct/Client.ts) file and add your newly made folder to the command loader function:
```ts
// Sub-content of src/struct/Client.ts
/**
 * Load commands
 * @returns {Promise<void>}
 */
private async loadCommands(): Promise<void> {
  ...
  const commandModules = await Promise.all([
    ...
    import('../cmd/fun'), // Statically import the folder
  ]);
  ...
};
```
- Run the development bot and publish the command with `bun dev:publish`
- Voil√†! Your command is now on Discord, as `/fun ping`.
